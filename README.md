The SOLID principles are a set of five software engineering principles that are designed to improve the quality of software and make it more maintainable, extensible, and sustainable. These principles are:

## 1- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Every class should have only one responsibility. This helps classes become more open and understandable, and less affected by changes.

## 2- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Software modules should be open to extension, but closed to modification. This makes software more resistant to changes and makes it easier to expand.

## 3- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subclasses should be able to replace their parent classes. This ensures that the software works properly and reduces code repetition.

## 4- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Unused interfaces should not be implemented by classes. This makes software more flexible and allows classes to only implement the functions they need.

## 5- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. This makes software more flexible and modular, and avoids tightly-coupled parts of software.
